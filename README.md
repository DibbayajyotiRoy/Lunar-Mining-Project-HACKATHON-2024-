# Lunar Mining Optimization System

A system to optimize space mining operations by considering resource availability, efficiency, and sustainability. It includes a user-friendly interface and a machine learning model to predict optimal mining sites by identifying Minerals.

## Description

The Lunar Mining Optimization System is an innovative project aimed at predicting and identifying the types of minerals found in lunar soil. Utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, this system leverages various data points, including wavelength measurements, spectral reflectance data from mineral separates, and particulate bulk samples. By analyzing these data points, the system can effectively determine the mineral composition of the lunar regolith, which is crucial for future lunar exploration and resource utilization.

### Overview of Use

The Lunar Mining Optimization System is designed for researchers, scientists, and space exploration organizations interested in lunar resource utilization. By providing accurate mineral identification, the system supports:
In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU): Understanding the mineral composition of lunar soil is essential for developing strategies to utilize these resources effectively. This includes extracting water, oxygen, and other valuable materials that can support long-term lunar missions.

Mission Planning: The insights generated by the system can inform mission planners about the most promising mining sites on the lunar surface, optimizing resource extraction efforts and reducing operational costs.

Environmental Sustainability: By identifying the most abundant and accessible mineral resources, the system aids in planning sustainable mining operations that minimize environmental impact on the lunar surface.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The project is built using a combination of technologies:
Frontend: Developed with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a responsive user interface, allowing users to interact with the system seamlessly.

Backend: Flask and FastAPI are utilized to handle API requests and manage data processing.

Machine Learning: Python is employed for developing the machine learning model, utilizing libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas for data analysis and model training, using Tensorflow.

### Installing

* Install Node Modules
* Install Flask and FastAPI

### Executing program

* Open the terminal
```
Cd src
Cd sections
```
* Start the backend server
```
Uvicorn main:app --reload
```

* open another terminal and run Next.js file

```
npm rundev
```
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

* You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

* This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
